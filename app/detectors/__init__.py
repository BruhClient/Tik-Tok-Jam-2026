"""Detector registry.

clip_head.py is the real model: a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 tower plus the trained
MLP head, loaded from the bundle at models/bundle.pt. trained.py stays as the
generic slot for any other checkpoint dropped at models/model.pt.

Importing a detector module is what registers it - the @register decorator runs
at import time - so a new backend has to be imported here to exist. The imports
below are therefore load-bearing, not unused, which is what the noqa marks say.
Importing a module must stay cheap: torch is imported inside load(), so that
`--list-detectors` does not pay for a framework it will not use.
