"""The trained model: loads a checkpoint from disk and scores images with it.

This is the real backend. It ships wired but with no weights - drop a
checkpoint at models/model.pt (or pass --weights) and every entry point starts
using it automatically, because available_detectors() ranks a ready real
backend above the placeholders.

    python detect.py <dir>                          uses models/model.pt
    python detect.py <dir> --weights runs/best.pt   uses that instead

Two checkpoint shapes load with no code changes:

  * TorchScript  - torch.jit.save(torch.jit.script(model), "models/model.pt")
    Self-contained: architecture travels with the weights. Preferred.
  * Pickled nn.Module - torch.save(model, "models/model.pt")
    Needs the defining class importable at load time.

A bare state_dict cannot be loaded on its own - nothing in it says what
architecture to build - so build_model() below is where you say. The
preprocessing and output constants at the top are the other things to check
against how the model was actually trained; they are the common defaults, not
a guess that is guaranteed right.
